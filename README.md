## Intro
Planning an overseas trip can be a lot of work, requiring time and effort to find ideal points-of-interest (POI) and transportation. We often have to narrow down all the possibilities to a few by weighing up different criteria, such as rating, theme, cost, proximity, and visiting hours. Mapster is a web and mobile app that helps people to quickly plan a trip from start to finish. Mapster takes the pain out of having to manually plan different parts of a trip using different websites.

Mapster is a map-based trip planner for the independent traveler. Users mark points-of-interests (POIs) and travel information on the map. Users can also ask Mapster to suggest POIs near a location on the map. Mapster finds the best route between the POIs to create a map-based itinerary.
